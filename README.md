### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Riana and I'm a third year software engineering student at McGill University. I'm interested in computer vision, data science, and algorithms and exploring the applications of technology in fields like healthcare and sociology. I have experience in Java, Python, Bash, JavaScript, and C.

Some projects I've worked on:

- [Movie Recommender](https://github.com/rianadutta/MovieRecommender)
- [Quantum Battleship](https://github.com/gabriellemacinnes/Quantum_Battleship/tree/main)
- [DevMate](https://github.com/rylandonohoe/DevMate)
